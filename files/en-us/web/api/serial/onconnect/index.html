<p class="summary">The <strong><code>onconnect</code></strong> {{domxref("EventHandler")}} of the {{domxref("Serial")}} interface is called when a port has been disconnected from the device. This method receives an {{domxref("Event")}} object. This event is only fired for ports associated with removable devices such as those connected via USB. Thetarget of this event is the {{domxref("SerialPort")}} interface that has been disconnected. The user must grant the origin permission to access this device during a call to {{domxref("requestPort()")}} before this event will be fired.</p>

<pre class="syntaxbox">Serial.onconnect = <var>function(event)</var>;
Serial.addEventListener('connect', <var>function(event)</var>);</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example shows how a site can check for available ports and allow
  the user to grant it permission to access more.</p>
  
<p>On load event listeners are added for the <code>connect</code> and <code>disconnect</code> events so that the site can react when a device is connected or disconnected from the system. The <code>getPorts()</code> method is then called to see which ports are connected that the site already has access to.</p>

<p>If the site doesn't have access to any connected ports it has to wait until it has user activation to proceed. In this example that is done using a {{domxref("Element.click_event")}} event handler on a button. A filter is passed to <code>requestPort()</code> with a USB vendor ID in order to limit the set of devices shown to the user to only USB devices built by a particular manufacturer. The filter can be omitted to allow the user to select any available port.</p>

<pre class="brush: js notranslate">navigator.serial.addEventListener('connect', (e) => {
  // Connect to `e.target` or add it to a list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.addEventListener('disconnect', (e) => {
  // Remove `e.target` from the list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.getPorts().then((ports) => {
  // Initialize the list of available ports with `ports` on page load.
});

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const usbVendorId = ...;
  navigator.serial.requestPort({ filters: [{ usbVendorId }]}).then((port) => {
    // Connect to `port` or add it to the list of available ports.
  }).catch((e) => {
    // The user didn't select a port.
  });
});</pre>
